# Artemis Python Slides

These are the slides intended to be used for teaching the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
programming language in conjunction with the [Artemis](https://artemis-app.inf.tu-dresden.de/)
exercises.

## Building

To build the slides with pandoc execute:

```sh
make all
```

The resulting PDF files are located in the `output` directory.

## Slides

The slides dont have to be taught in a specific order, but the following one is recommended:

 1. The Language

 2. Bytes and Strings

 3. Functions, Objects and Classes

 4. int and float 

 5. Exceptions and Context managers

 6. Modules and Packages

 7. Collections and Iterators

 8. Decorators and advanced Functions

 9. Comprehensions

## Artemis exercises

Almost every slide has an accompanying exercise in the [iFSR Artemis Course](https://artemis-app.inf.tu-dresden.de/courses/6/exercises).

It is recommended that the exercises are started after teaching Functions, Objects and Classes.
